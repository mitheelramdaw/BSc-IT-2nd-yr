2.1 Amazon is a company that has utilized cloud computing to improve its M-commerce business activities and gain a competitive edge over its rivals.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services, including storage, databases, analytics, and machine learning. By using AWS, Amazon is able to provide a reliable and scalable platform for its M-commerce activities.
Improved Scalability: One of the key benefits of cloud computing for M-commerce is scalability. As the demand for Amazon's services increases, AWS can quickly and easily allocate additional resources to meet the increased demand. This ensures that Amazon's M-commerce activities can handle the increased traffic without experiencing any downtime or performance issues.
Cost-Effective: Using cloud computing is also cost-effective for Amazon, as it eliminates the need for large capital investments in hardware and software. Instead, Amazon can pay for the cloud services it needs on a pay-as-you-go basis, which allows the company to reduce its operating costs and invest in other areas of its business.
Improved Efficiency: Another benefit of cloud computing for Amazon's M-commerce activities is improved efficiency. With AWS, Amazon can automate its infrastructure management and streamline its development processes, which reduces the time and resources needed to deploy new features and updates. This allows Amazon to stay ahead of its competitors by providing innovative features and a better user experience for its customers.
Increased Security: Cloud computing also provides increased security for Amazon's M-commerce activities. AWS has robust security measures in place, including firewalls, encryption, and multi-factor authentication. By using AWS, Amazon can ensure that its customer data is protected and its M-commerce activities are secure.
Conclusion: Amazon's use of cloud computing through AWS has improved its M-commerce business activities and given the company a competitive edge over its rivals. By providing improved scalability, cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and security, AWS has allowed Amazon to innovate and improve its M-commerce services while reducing its operating costs. As cloud computing continues to evolve, Amazon will likely continue to use this technology to improve its M-commerce activities and maintain its position as a leader in the e-commerce industry.

Question 4	(20 Marks)

4.1 As the person in charge of developing our fast-growing start-up's e-commerce presence in South Africa, I have been evaluating two strategies for building our e-commerce platform: building it in-house or outsourcing the entire operation. In this presentation, I will explain my position on the best approach for our company and the estimated associated costs for both options.
Option 1: Building the e-commerce platform in-house with existing staff
The first option is to build the e-commerce platform in-house using our existing staff. This approach has several advantages. Firstly, we have complete control over the development process and can customize the platform to our specific needs. Secondly, it allows us to leverage the existing expertise and knowledge of our staff, reducing the need to hire external consultants. Finally, it is a more cost-effective option in the long run since we will not have to pay recurring fees to an external vendor.
However, building an e-commerce platform in-house will require a significant investment of time, money, and resources. We will need to allocate dedicated staff to work on the project, which could take away from other important initiatives. Additionally, we will need to purchase any necessary software, hardware, and equipment to support the development process, which could increase costs.
Estimated costs for building the e-commerce platform in-house:
Staff salaries and benefits: R4,200,000 per year Software, hardware, and equipment: R2,100,000 upfront cost Training and development: R700,000 upfront cost Total estimated cost: R7,000,000 for the first year, R4,200,000 for each subsequent year.
Option 2: Outsourcing the entire e-commerce operation
The second option is to outsource the entire e-commerce operation to an external vendor. This approach has several advantages, including faster development time, reduced risk, and lower upfront costs.
By outsourcing the e-commerce operation, we can focus on our core competencies and leave the development and maintenance of the platform to experts. Additionally, we will not have to invest in any hardware, software, or equipment since the vendor will provide everything we need.
However, outsourcing comes with a few downsides. Firstly, we will have less control over the development process, which could result in a platform that does not meet all of our requirements. Secondly, we will have to pay recurring fees to the vendor, which could increase costs in the long run.
Estimated costs for outsourcing the entire e-commerce operation:
Set-up fees: R700,000 upfront cost Recurring fees: R280,000 per month Total estimated cost: R4,360,000 for the first year, R3,600,000 for each subsequent year.
Conclusion:
After evaluating both options, I recommend outsourcing the entire e-commerce operation to an external vendor. This approach will allow us to focus on our core competencies and leave the development and maintenance of the platform to experts. Additionally, it will require less upfront investment and allow for faster development time. The estimated costs for outsourcing are also lower than building the platform in-house with existing staff.

    3. Security: Security is a critical factor in e-commerce as it involves the handling of sensitive customer information. The platform must have robust security features to protect customer data and prevent fraud.
    4. Payment Gateways: Payment gateways are crucial for processing payments and should be integrated seamlessly into the platform. The platform should support a variety of payment methods to accommodate customer preferences.
    5. Third-Party Integration: Third-party integrations allow for the integration of additional features, such as marketing tools and analytics, into the platform. The platform should support a variety of third-party integrations to enhance functionality.
    6. Customer Support: Customer support is essential in ensuring the smooth running of the platform. The platform should offer various support channels and responsive customer service.
    7. Pricing: Pricing is an important consideration when choosing an e-commerce software platform. The platform should offer a competitive pricing structure with no hidden fees.
Based on the evaluation chart, I would choose E-commerce Software Package B. It scored higher in all key factors except for pricing, where it scored one point less than E-commerce Software Package A. E-commerce Software Package B has a better user interface, is more scalable, more secure, supports more payment gateways, has better third-party integrations, and offers better customer support. These factors are crucial in developing a successful e-commerce website, and I believe E-commerce Software Package B would be the better choice.
